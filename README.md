# Personal-Expense-Tracker
Just a project made for my portfolio. A simple personal expense tracker

A full-stack web application for managing daily expenses with user authentication, expense categorization, and spending summaries. Developed with React for frontend, Node.js + Express for backend, and integrated a PostgreSQL database. Implemented CRUD functionalities and deployed the app on Vercel and Render for live usage.
